# 🏡 House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

A Machine Learning project to predict house prices using the classic Boston Housing dataset.  
This project demonstrates end-to-end ML workflow including data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and insights.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a **Linear Regression model** that predicts the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) based on multiple housing-related features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, age of houses, accessibility to highways, etc.

This project is ideal for understanding:
- How regression algorithms work  
- How features impact price prediction  
- How to evaluate regression models  
- How to present an ML project professionally
- 
## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset:** Boston Housing dataset  
- **Target Variable:** MEDV (Median value of homes in \$1000s)  
- **Number of features:** 13  
- **Common features used:**
  - CRIM – crime rate  
  - RM – average number of rooms per dwelling  
  - LSTAT – % lower status population  
  - PTRATIO – pupil–teacher ratio  
  - etc.
